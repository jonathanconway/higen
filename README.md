> _a convention-based templated folder and file generator_

`higen` allows you to easily and quickly create templates which can be used to generate folders and files in any structure you wish.

- [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) is used as the templating language
- Folder names and file names can both contain template tokens
- HiGen provides some built-in values, such as current Git branch name and repo and current date and time

## Getting started

### Installing the CLI

Get started by installing HiGen via the CLI.

#### What you'll need
